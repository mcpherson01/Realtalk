Older people who game are on average happier than those who do not. The release of adrenaline and dopamine from gaming may lead to enhanced learning capability.</p><p>Writing teaches thinking. ‘Read’ means to ‘guess,’ in Latin. (Alan Watts) Writers learn to think more in their internal voice and reason through ideas and problems and quickly spit them onto the page. In this way, perhaps it also enhances thinking speed and reading, decision making. Watts suggests readers have very good judgement, because they have to make so many guesses whilst reading  due to the ambiguousness of English.</p><p>Steve Jobs credits his greatest influences as being meditation and LSD. Mediation involves actively trying to be passive. Thinking of nothing, in the case of Zen. You must simply observe and not make any judgement, experience and not have any preconceived ideas. It is quiet time where you abstain from thinking, whilst being in a mentally active state, to reach a true understanding of the world.</p><p>Is, therefore, anything a waste of time?</p><p>I suppose some things may be comparatively  more useful than others.</p><p>The difference between a mad man and a sane man is that the sane man can justify why he does something.</p><p>‘Madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome’ – Farcry 3</p><p>In Australia, we have much more people in the Baby Boomers, Gen X category than in Y. Trends show less births in younger generational groups. Are we not, therefore going to have a voting populace that is rooted heavily in the present? They will be dead before they see the consequences of their own decision making. Will we always have voting that is slanted towards people that the decisions do-not and will-not effect? People that are already firmly established in the world. The way things are going, i’ll be home and unemployed till 35. Doomed by ‘democracy.’</p><p>Free Flow</p><p>Annabel hated forests. They were just far too green for her liking. Green leaves, green grass, it was all putrid. It was as if nature had permanently decided to mark itself as envious. Envious of mammals and people, who could think and breathe with lungs and move at more than 1km per 100 years.</p><p>“I’ll burn it down!” She exclaimed, in the privacy of her hut. Later that night Annabel headed to the forrest. It was dark, and there was not a soul in sight. She grabbed two exploding palm muffins and then gave them to her dog charlie. Charlie was overjoyed and EXPLODED into mushroom flowers. ‘OH JOY!’ Little Annabel Nancy thought to herself. Now the Forest was full of colour and her dog Charlie was a cat, but of the worst kind however!</p><p>“This american auto-correct is pissing me off!” She said. Charlie agreed, as he shat out more coloured mushrooms. “Why the fuck would you change a perfectly good language?” It made no sense, it was almost as confusing as why they had chosen the drive on what everyone had agreed was, ‘the wrong side of the road.’</p><p>The fire became colour monkeys and the monkey demons flew up and said , “it’s time to get back to that philosophy assignment!111!1″ as they turned to angel demons and made Annabel a man. In the wise words of the Sicilian Mafia, “If i die I forgive you, If I live, I’ll kill you.” Too strong perhaps, need a lighter coffee, adios!</p><p>philosophy, humour &amp; some guy bitching about his life.<br /> Archives<br /> February 2014<br /> January 2014<br /> December 2013<br /> November 2013<br /> September 2013<br /> August 2013<br /> July 2013<br /> June 2013<br /> May 2013<br /> April 2013<br /> The Twenty Fourteen Theme Blog at WordPress.com.<br /> Follow<br /> Follow “Journey Towards Enlightenment”<br /> Get every new post delivered to your Inbox.</p><p>Join 90 other followers</p><p>Enter your email address</p><p>Powered by WordPress.com<br /> Wayback Machine</p><p>http://journeytowardsenlightenment.com/2013/11/<br /> DEC FEB MAR<br /> Previous capture    20  Next capture<br /> 2013    2014    2015<br /> 7 captures<br /> 7 Nov 2013 &#8211; 20 Feb 2014<br /> About this capture</p><p>Journey Towards Enlightenment<br /> Search<br /> Primary Menu<br /> Skip to content<br /> Welcome to Journey Towards Enlightenment!<br /> Search for:<br /> Search …</p><p>Monthly Archives: November 2013<br /> Uncategorized<br /> Ikea Job requirements; translated<br /> November 23, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> Love people and finding solutions to their customers’ needs</p><p>Tolerates people</p><p>Aim to give each and every customer a positive shopping experience</p><p>Isn’t a dick</p><p>Have a genuine interest in home furnishings</p><p>Can feign interest in our product range</p><p>Have excellent communication skills</p><p>Englese comprende !</p><p>Are hands-on and use their initiative</p><p>Does what we say, doesn’t mind limited intellectual stimulation</p><p>Become home furnishing specialists who want to develop in their role or as a future leader</p><p>Aspires to become a couch</p><p>Uncategorized<br /> Exam ‘shrinkage’ and Impoverish WiFi<br /> November 20, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> shrinkage<br /> an allowance made for reduction in the takings of a business due to wastage or theft</p><p>Is this metaphorical? A brand maybe? I don’t see the connection…Poor guy.</p><p>I’m sure this has happened to everyone, but I could easily just be especially lazy when it comes to following instructions.  I just had an exam and for whatever reason I wrote three essays instead of two and then didn’t have time to edit or critique these terrible pieces of literature.<br /> I call this ‘shrinkage’ because in spite of preparation… Errors become like wastage.<br /> I just feel sorry for the exam marker reading it all and thinking im quite and idiot.  The subject was an english unit, creative writing, and  my short story was about a whale man who turned out to be a drugged man with a son who was also actually whale.  It had no descriptive language, only dialogue (ran out of time!!) but hopefully they will get a laugh out of it, even if my ass only gets 5%.<br /> I’m sitting on the floor at the door of my room at 1.08am.  The internet keeps cutting out and I need to be close to the WiFi or it loses connection entirely.  Like an body of water, the warm spots are nice, but then you realise you are swimming in piss.  The WiFi hotspots in my house are pretty much the same deal.  I would sit out in the open, but it’s not worth waking anyone up… So i just lie here on the floor, youtube music playing and then pausing and playing… forever.<br /> Uncategorized<br /> I so sick of university and the attitude of university students<br /> November 20, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> My friend linked me to this on reddit. It’s great! I’m almost exactly the type of guy he is describing;</p><p>Just spreading the hate!</p><p>“This is going to be a long, scattered, disjunctive rant about a variety of things that have been eating away at me lately. Apologies in advance for the lack of flowing structure.</p><p>I can’t tell if I’m just a cynical, jaded asshole or if everyone around me really is as full over-optimistic pseudo-intellectual bullshit as I perceive them to be. Probably a bit of both.</p><p>someone posted a message on one of the university student facebook groups during midterm season that was the most concentrated stream of over-optimistic shit I think I have ever read.</p><p>Oh my god guys, I know everyone is really stressed about midterms but youre all beautiful people and were all in this together and were all going to make it out fine. I know you guys can do this, we’re all going to study and make it through okay, we can do this Gryphs you’re all the best! etc. etc. etc. 700 likes.</p><p>shut the fuck up.</p><p>Not everyone is going to make it through midterms. People are going to fail their courses. People are going to get put on academic probation and risk losing their government student loan funding. People already on academic probation are going to get kicked out. People are going to drop out and waste thousands of dollars. Cut the pep-talk bullshit, we’re all fucking adults, not first graders. This isnt some kind of Disney fairy tale where everything works out in the end.</p><p>Is it weird that this bugs me so much? I honestly don’t know why this irritates me so much but it does. so. fucking. much.</p><p>And then there’s the whole activism/social justice shit that ties in with all this optimism. My god. Every time I walk through the student center someone is trying to start some new movement. The Kony 2012 campaign was lead by university students like this and is a testament to the absolute stupidity of this kind of mentality. Hoards of people signing up for these disgusting “voluntourism” trips that tie in “volunteer” work in impoverished nations with luxury/adventure tourism. Nothing like getting your picture taken with some of the poorest people on the planet so that you can show everyone on Facebook what a great free-spirited person you are, and then paying more money than those people will make in an entire year to go swim with some dolphins.</p><p>Everyone gets so fucking indignant and opinionated about social issues that I swear any sort of post on the student forums divulges into some kind of argument about rape culture, transgender rights, abortion, politics, etc.</p><p>Yes, I get it, you took PSYC 101, Philosophy 101, and an intro politics course. Regale me with your enlightened, intellectual opinion on foreign affairs and how Aristotle’s view on ethics can be applied to the abortion debate (because your prof talked about that once and he sounded pretty smart, so you should just parrot him rather than doing any real in-depth thought about the issue).</p><p>Everyone is trying to be some kind of unique and quirky “special snowflake” and it annoys the shit out of me. I was over at my girlfriend’s house and two of her roommates were literally just SCREAMING Harry Potter quotes at each other for a good 15 minutes. Yes oh hahaha Harry Potter you’re so quirky and weird haha I bet Tumblr would love this shit. But you’re 20 years old. Despite what Reddit and Tumblr would have you believe there’s nothing quirky, unique or entertaining about listening to two 20 year olds scream Harry Potter related things at each other for 15 straight minutes. It’s embarrassing.</p><p>And then there’s the whole culture of drinking. Substance abuse has never been so accepted, so encouraged. It’s gotten to the point where getting absolutely wasted 4 or 5 nights a week has become an acceptable part of university life. But we dont dare call these people alcoholics. Oh no. Theyre “party animals” or “social butterflies”, not alcoholics. Alcoholics are 40 year old men who drink a bottle of scotch after work to go home and beat the shit out of their wife and kids, not us optimistic invincible university students who have everything going for them right now. We’re just having a good time.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I do drink with my friends, I get blackout drunk sometimes, but I have my fucking priorities in order. I’m not out there pounding back Jager bombs the night before a big midterm. I went out downtown a few weeks ago and ran into a friend of a friend who loudly exclaimed “DUDE, YOU FINALLY LEFT YOUR ROOM!”.</p><p>Yes, I did finally leave my room, because the workload for my Molecular Biology and Genetics/Neuroscience degreefinally allowed me to do so. Because not all of us are majoring in theater studies you lazy, alcoholic fuckwit.

I guess a little understanding goes a long way.</p><p>Golf  &#8211; I’ve been to the driving range a lot and I notice that everyone hits the same shot over and over and none of them seemed that great, so I’m doing it differently.  I’ve been practicing a reversed grip shot, a standalone left hand shot, a standalone right hand and then the generic shot, occasionally lining up balls so I have to think fast to adjust my shot and grip.</p><p>Rational – Of course this looks kind of weird to everyone else, but I seem to be improving quickly. I figure if I improve overall hand-eye co-ordination I will improve at all sports and have a more controlled shot.</p><p>I’ve also practiced sledge-hammer swinging ,  I’m at the point where I can swing a 15kg sledgehammer with either hand completely controlled with varying angles and force.   This had definitely added a ridiculous amount of strength to my shot.  Of course, you are taking it from me. 😉</p><p>Sketching- I’ve been specifically practicing landscapes.  Learning the fundamentals; mountains, rocks, rivers and what-have-you.  I have moved on to  drawing free hand rather than copying so it seems to be going ‘okay’ there’s room for improvement, I draw like a schizophrenic.</p><p>Coding-  I’ve narrowed this down to following along with video tutorials on HTML and CSS.  I’ve since moved on to PHP and am learning the fundamentals.

Like my Soul</p><p>Oh such a grand day when you look forward to nothing but an unnaturally early start to the day just to be a mandatory guinea-pig-bitch for some ungrateful self-important Masters student studying reaction times. I arrogantly believe I could design better and more innovative and entertaining experiments than the ones assigned to us. Most experiments involve clicking a single button whenever something appears on the screen. During verbal fluency experiments, the experimenter just stares at you in this judgemental, analytical way. The way my piece of shit GP looked at me when I went to his office with swollen tonsils and a cold and he said it was hay-fever , sending me away to suffer with a sore throat and blocked nose feeling like a guilty hypochondriac. Anyway, I messed up this experiment one morning. I got there late went to the wrong room etc. I then sent an apologetic email and got this cold one sentence saying that it,</p><p>‘Wasn’t an excuse’ and ‘I don’t know how you could get confused with that?’</p><p>“That’s right,” I replied, “It wasn’t an excuse, rather an apology. Best of luck finding further more spatially aware guineapigs. With love, James.</p><p>Frankly, I’m at the point where I see most people as ‘having done a course,’ rather than ‘professionals.’ The term itself suggests that they have plateaued at some optimal level, like there is no more room for growth.  Isn’t that just like saying ‘Taxi drivers are the best drivers,’ in other words that years driving means better driving. Heck, I’m on my Red P plates so I’m fresh out of the mill. I had a-lot of lessons, hundreds of dollars’ worth.  Not gloating (why would anyone gloat about that?) I’m just establishing that isn’t an ‘everyone is an idiot on the road except for me’ thing… Who am I kidding, of course it is! Driving almost every day now, I’ve noticed that 90% of drivers break some law and yes, I’m pulling stats out of my ass here.  Either they don’t indicate properly, drive one handed like a fucking cowboy with an arm and cig out the window, (Not against the law but still aggravating. The cigarette makes it worse) cross unbroken lines or invent their own speed limits! Fourty in the ‘sixty zone’ seventy in the ‘school zone’ etc. I couldn’t count on both hands the amount of times I’ve had some middle-aged expressionless dark-glasses wearing driver tailgate me hard in a fifty zone. (I like to call this un-consensual harassment of the rear) What gets to me the most is that probably assume by default that they are safer drivers. Gee, that’s what Australian stats say and we all know how accurate stereotypes and generalisations are!</p><p>On a side note I’m paying a lot of money (well, future me) for what seems to be limited education. I think on average I have four-five hours in lectures and tutes in the usual week.  Other time is consumed by travel, sleeping due to early start times and at the Tavern. I asked a tutor why we had such irrelevant boring texts to read for our Comm course. She replied;</p><p>“Because you should be spending one-hour out of class for every hour in!” I then said,</p><p>“Well isn’t that just quantity over quality?”</p><p>She simply shook her head and said “no.”</p><p>Good to see I’m finally, getting some answers around here right? In any case, I have faith that one day I’ll get to the bottom of ‘the system’ and ‘the real world’ or whatever other miserable and pathetic word you use to vaguely describe some way of living that you were born into.</p><p>Expanding more on this, why is time always is managed in blocks? Why can’t we just have tasks or objectives? You know, things to do rather than blocks of time, as makes logical sense.  A sprinter doesn’t plan to be spending one hour sprinting, he/she has planned sets of distances etc. The goal is to complete the task (the sprints) as quickly and effectively as possible and I feel this should be the goal of work.  This bullshit 10 hour study week doesn’t help anyone, it’s just like working out 10 hours every day and expecting to bulk hard like Kim-John-Uhng. (Doesn’t deserve his name spelt correctly) Fuck it, just make everything a game.  Give me a google-glass with achievements, waypoints and with inconspicuous access to porn and I’ll stop complaining.</p><p>If it wasn’t obvious enough from the title, I feel like I’m becoming part of the wall.  Or at least, it’s equivalent. My position as ‘student’ is to sit and listen.  A routine all too familiar from school days.  It takes just about every ounce of strength to break free from that harsh primary school conditioning taught by baby-boomers.  Discipline, hand-raising and being silent unless spoken to. The complete guide on being a pussy who achieves nothing in life.  Well I guess we need to cut them some slack, there were after all taught with capital punishment and whipping, more than a decade and I half later I’m still getting over the ‘Hitler-youth’ regime and that authority figure anxiety.  I’m honestly questioning why I’m not an arsonist.</p><p>With love,</p><p>Teen angst incarnate</p><p>boredomexperiencehomogeneitylifepurposelessrantuni<br /> inspitation, Uncategorized<br /> Intolerance, Agression and Facebook Totalitarianism<br /> November 7, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> I recently got into a facebook brawl, one of many.</p><p>NATO-Preparing-For-World-War-3-1<br /> Ladies and Gentlemen, this is WWIII.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking, yeah it was really silly of me.  I slipped, I forgot that trying to discuss topics on social mediums is like trying to convince angry conservative cows that they have three stomachs.  Frankly, It’s made me feel ashamed to be in this country.  To any readers, remember this is Australia, we support the poor/disabled/low-income people we have ‘Obama-Care.’  What a stupid intolerant name for something you should have anyway but I’ll leave that alone for now.</p><p>In passing I commented on this status, almost without a second thought. It was with regards to giving homeless people on the street money.  I’m sure that some people are already flaming, thinking they know my point-of-view here, as did everyone on facebook.  Hear me out.</p><p>abuse</p><p>While my opinion seems republican, once we get to dissecting it (in response to a personal attack) I explain how it’s actually the more liberal-democratic view helping a much greater number.  More bang for the same buck.</p><p>Raising this point I was met with perhaps one legitimate response directed at my ignorance (which I don’t deny) that homeless people cannot get bank accounts apparently, I took that.  All other comments however were directed entirely at me, so many ad hominem (argument against the man) fallicies instead of critical reasoning against the argument.  Everyone is terrified of leaving the comfort of their own minds and the lash out and defend it with everything they have.  It’s exhausting.</p><p>Capture2</p><p>I admit this guy called me out on this one, put like that I sound like an ass, so I clarified what I had mean’t to say being a tad cheeky with the vocab. It’s frustrating trying to reason with the unreasonable.</p><p>Captur3e</p><p>Just abuse! Yay! Young people these days are so promising aren’t they?</p><p>Oh shit, we even got some Gen X ladies in here! At this point my heart was racing, how can people be so enraged by the comment of some random guy?  Then get even more aggravated when you explain what they questioned!</p><p>Captu6re</p><p>I’m not even going to get into the fact of how not being ‘university educated’ has anything to do with not being able to differentiate ‘judgement’ from ‘opinion’ or as an excuse for an inability to Google.  It almost sounds like a bitter jealousy and it’s full of stereotypes and assumptions.  Both of which are horrible parasites of the mind.</p><p>Let’s throw some ageism in the mix!  I’m not experienced enough…. What for?  An opinion? I guess once I pass the 30 mark everything I say will suddenly have more merit.  Let’s be honest  lady, you don’t seem very experienced in English or emotional intelligence (I’m not saying that I have any) but because you served soup to homeless people you are the infallible Pope and I’m the villain, yes, that’s it, I’m the Jew, I’m the reason you have bad finances!</p><p>Someone correct me if I’m wrong (which I’m not) but $50.00 AUD goes a lot further if you send it through a charity that helps build communities or services.  When people see homeless people they feel bad, obviously, but somehow when things are ‘out of sight, out of mind’ it doesn’t matter, all that matters is the intention.  Let’s build a world on good intentions and call it fucking Narnia!  A place where Morgan freeman is God and Michael Jackson is sings Thriller in the town square for eternity!  Well shit, Hitler probably had good intentions.</p><p>In the end she brings up that she participated in one of the services (which is what I initially referred to in saying that they don’t need our street change) in my first comment, but I let it go, it wasn’t worth any more energy.</p><p>materuial</p><p>The comparison between myself and her nephew (the one who posted the status) is kind of ironic, the poster of the status is a very nice chap but has a strong persisting reputation for lying in status’ and I know for a fact that he generates followers on his facebook to look more popular.  There you have it.  Every vocal person on this social media medium seems intolerant and self-righteous.  At times like these I think we should employ Country wide Pluralism, (Group of elites run the country without citizen consent) But I hope it’s not that bad in reality.</p><p>Oh yeah and straight after I took those screenshots, the abusive guy deleted his comments so it looked like I was swearing at the Gen X woman/mother!

It’s great, she’s enjoying it, it’s easier on the family and everyone is happy, the world is good right?  Well that is questionable.  Being a long time church-goer and friend of the priest she was able to pull some strings…  By that I mean her Parish Priest had a word with the authority figures of the aged care home and got her from fifth-on-the-list to straight into the home!  It didn’t end there, another elderly relative had the same special treatment from the same priest.</p><p>I asked my Grandma about the issue.  “Gran, what do you think about Aunty Jean and Aunty Josie jumping the queue?  (Trying to propose the question as neutrally as possible) What about everyone else? ” She replied with,</p><p>“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”</p><p>A phrase that seems to be irritatingly common with that generation.</p><p>Hold up, is that a justification?  (Of course I didn’t quiz her on this).  Life-long parishioners and the Parish Priest of a Catholic Church are okay with this behaviour?  Do they not worship Jesus?

Also, I’m coming back as a cow. PREPARE TO WORSHIP ME, thanks.</p><p>—————————————————————————————————————</p><p>Through my dealings online this mid-year break, I think I have learned a thing or two about outsourcing. That is, sending projects or work to third world countries to be completed for a low price. As $1(US Dollar) is currently worth $59.08 (Indian Rupee) I can’t see how this doesn’t benefit both parties. Maybe one side more than the other.</p><p>The majority of overseas ‘workers’ I have been in contact with are absolutely horrible awful and at a primary school level of English competency. They are all out to make a quick dollar. They don’t care too much about the job and will lie, deceit and do whatever it takes to get the better end of the deal. They will present this completely falsified portrait of themselves as some amazingly successful businessman who has been doing (insert job here) for 8 years etc. You will later find out that you have a team of 13 year old working for you out of a basement. If I didn’t already make this astronomically clear, quality is shithouse. This kind of manipulation and fraud by ‘poor helpless third-worlders’ is making me xenophobic and I’m a tolerant man.</p><p>I’m having outsources from china, India and other desolate shitholes send me emails hourly. My main email account is virtually unusable, and has since been abandoned like Chernobyl after nukes hit. “Dear sir, would  u like intarsted be in or offers? <em>lists offers</em>,” I think I’m having heart palpitations, it’s just so frustrating, all of it and I’m filled with rage, murderous rage. This truly is a ‘Nut Grindin’ situation to be in.</p><p>My freelance.com account is filled with all these messages and false bids. For example, I’ll post an advertisement clearly stating the job, and my budget, let’s say ’$10-30’ for a couple articles. I will have an inbox is soulless leeches trying to make me their gold whore or money bunny, what have you. Placing bids of $10 publicly and then private messaging me their $500000 monthly plans and then constantly pestering when I do not reply within an hour. “hello sir?,” “u ther?” “can do job giv details start now.” No you can’t start now, you stupid inarticulate, scammy fucker, you can start with drowning yourself in a pool of my finances, which to me is virtually 50 bucks and some pubic hair, but is to a third-worlder (apparently) a profitable oil-mining location.</p><p>Oh yeah, I also bought another site online, this one looked decent. The man I purchased it from refuses to pay for site transfer (guess where he’s from! 🙂 India, the trust country!), in which he clearly stated he would in the advertisement, thus purchasing the item under complete false pretence, he vanished off the face of the web, at least the site he left is decent. No one ever stops to think about the poor exploited 1stworlder losing both time, money and sanity. Just because their house are made of clay, they feel that they need not be accountable. (Foreign outsourcers; how do you have internet..?)</p><p>I’m just exhausted and flustered, I can imagine why people like the familiarity and reliability of buying things in person or from trusted, renowned organisations. It makes things easier but for a poor student, that just ain’t gonna happen, and I don’t think I could stomach going back to the workforce just yet, after last year (Refer to gap yearblog). I think I can empathise with that thirteen-year-old workforce who work in a basement, get the job done to their best abilities and don’t get any return (sounds familiar). Back at uni tomorrow, it better be worthwhile this time, I need to meet new people… I learnt all my courses in the two weeks leading to exams (essentially) and spent most of the other time at the Tavern with mates. Drunk uni wooo!(undecided whether or not this is sarcasm) I just got locked out of wordpress for entering the wrong password too many times and my phone ran out of battery so I cannot respond to the password retrieve code… Good game life.</p><p>brazildrunkEmploymentexperiencefunhumourindiaoutsourcingoverseasregretuni<br /> philosophy, humour &amp; some guy bitching about his life.<br /> Archives<br /> February 2014<br /> January 2014<br /> December 2013<br /> November 2013<br /> September 2013<br /> August 2013<br /> July 2013<br /> June 2013<br /> May 2013<br /> April 2013<br /> The Twenty Fourteen Theme Blog at WordPress.com.<br /> Follow<br /> Follow “Journey Towards Enlightenment”<br /> Get every new post delivered to your Inbox.</p><p>Join 90 other followers</p><p>Enter your email address</p><p>Powered by WordPress.com</p><p>Wayback Machine</p><p>http://journeytowardsenlightenment.com/2013/11/<br /> DEC FEB MAR<br /> Previous capture    20  Next capture<br /> 2013    2014    2015<br /> 7 captures<br /> 7 Nov 2013 &#8211; 20 Feb 2014<br /> About this capture</p><p>Journey Towards Enlightenment<br /> Search<br /> Primary Menu<br /> Skip to content<br /> Welcome to Journey Towards Enlightenment!<br /> Search for:<br /> Search …</p><p>Monthly Archives: November 2013<br /> Uncategorized<br /> Ikea Job requirements; translated<br /> November 23, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> Love people and finding solutions to their customers’ needs</p><p>Tolerates people</p><p>Aim to give each and every customer a positive shopping experience</p><p>Isn’t a dick</p><p>Have a genuine interest in home furnishings</p><p>Can feign interest in our product range</p><p>Have excellent communication skills</p><p>Englese comprende !</p><p>Are hands-on and use their initiative</p><p>Does what we say, doesn’t mind limited intellectual stimulation</p><p>Become home furnishing specialists who want to develop in their role or as a future leader</p><p>Aspires to become a couch</p><p>Uncategorized<br /> Exam ‘shrinkage’ and Impoverish WiFi<br /> November 20, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> shrinkage<br /> an allowance made for reduction in the takings of a business due to wastage or theft</p><p>Is this metaphorical?

I honestly don’t know why this irritates me so much but it does. so. fucking. much.</p><p>And then there’s the whole activism/social justice shit that ties in with all this optimism. My god. Every time I walk through the student center someone is trying to start some new movement. The Kony 2012 campaign was lead by university students like this and is a testament to the absolute stupidity of this kind of mentality. Hoards of people signing up for these disgusting “voluntourism” trips that tie in “volunteer” work in impoverished nations with luxury/adventure tourism. Nothing like getting your picture taken with some of the poorest people on the planet so that you can show everyone on Facebook what a great free-spirited person you are, and then paying more money than those people will make in an entire year to go swim with some dolphins.</p><p>Everyone gets so fucking indignant and opinionated about social issues that I swear any sort of post on the student forums divulges into some kind of argument about rape culture, transgender rights, abortion, politics, etc.</p><p>Yes, I get it, you took PSYC 101, Philosophy 101, and an intro politics course. Regale me with your enlightened, intellectual opinion on foreign affairs and how Aristotle’s view on ethics can be applied to the abortion debate (because your prof talked about that once and he sounded pretty smart, so you should just parrot him rather than doing any real in-depth thought about the issue).</p><p>Everyone is trying to be some kind of unique and quirky “special snowflake” and it annoys the shit out of me. I was over at my girlfriend’s house and two of her roommates were literally just SCREAMING Harry Potter quotes at each other for a good 15 minutes. Yes oh hahaha Harry Potter you’re so quirky and weird haha I bet Tumblr would love this shit. But you’re 20 years old. Despite what Reddit and Tumblr would have you believe there’s nothing quirky, unique or entertaining about listening to two 20 year olds scream Harry Potter related things at each other for 15 straight minutes. It’s embarrassing.</p><p>And then there’s the whole culture of drinking. Substance abuse has never been so accepted, so encouraged. It’s gotten to the point where getting absolutely wasted 4 or 5 nights a week has become an acceptable part of university life. But we dont dare call these people alcoholics. Oh no. Theyre “party animals” or “social butterflies”, not alcoholics. Alcoholics are 40 year old men who drink a bottle of scotch after work to go home and beat the shit out of their wife and kids, not us optimistic invincible university students who have everything going for them right now. We’re just having a good time.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I do drink with my friends, I get blackout drunk sometimes, but I have my fucking priorities in order. I’m not out there pounding back Jager bombs the night before a big midterm. I went out downtown a few weeks ago and ran into a friend of a friend who loudly exclaimed “DUDE, YOU FINALLY LEFT YOUR ROOM!”.</p><p>Yes, I did finally leave my room, because the workload for my Molecular Biology and Genetics/Neuroscience degreefinally allowed me to do so. Because not all of us are majoring in theater studies you lazy, alcoholic fuckwit. But at least you have your DJ career going for you as a fallback.</p><p>I wonder what the response you be if I had turned it around on him and exclaimed “DUDE, YOU FINALLY DIDNT GET SHITFACE DRUNK 4 DAYS IN A ROW THIS WEEK”</p><p>I know I’m a cynical asshole. I know it’s a problem. I’m trying to change, I really, really am. But shit like this is making it difficult. I feel like my choices are either continue being the jaded cynical asshole that I currently am, or I put on a big, fake, optimistic smile and join the ranks of my peers; filling up my head with self-entitlement and hot air.”</p><p>Source: http://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1r0114/i_so_sick_of_university_and_the_attitude_of/</p><p>AristotleEducationfacebookKony 2012Molecular BiologyRedditshitStudent<br /> poetry<br /> Enclosed<br /> November 16, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment</p><p>Encapsulated for weeks like  a non-mandatory prison,</p><p>looking at this screen that keeps me awake at night,</p><p>my source of information,</p><p>my source of insomnia.</p><p>The infinite possibilities merely add to the anxieties,</p><p>like an RPG that’s  as convoluted as real life,</p><p>or like a mind so open, the  brain is falling out.</p><p>Wasting precious hours in this enclosure,</p><p>it’s damn well not helping myopia,</p><p>profusely sweating ,</p><p>hair in my face,</p><p>far too accustomed to leave the place.</p><p>A walk, to where?</p><p>The end is the start.</p><p>A change of scenery?</p><p>The same game in a different map.</p><p>Refuting the urge to yank  nails or teeth,</p><p>There’s no way in hell I could concentrate on reading ‘The Book Thief.’</p><p>My youth is wasting</p><p>and the sadness perpetuates.</p><p>Signed  sincerely,</p><p>a first world ingrate.</p><p>Conditions and DiseasesCovert operationgameHealthRole-playing gameRoleplayingRPGVideo Games<br /> cute<br /> Dangerous Dinner Table Opinions<br /> November 9, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> Wish I was watching porn right now<br /> fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck</p><p>Now, I’ve always been taught that if I didn’t have anything nice or socially acceptable to say, don’t say a word.

I’ve read every one, I’ve watched countless videos on accelerated learning and have been reading about the neuro-plasticity of the human brain.  More recently however, I have decided it’s time to employ some of these tactics.  There are a few general principles I have learned.</p><p>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority it’s time to reflect.</p><p>Deconstruct, Select, Sequence, Stakes (information)</p><p>It takes 20 hours to become very good at a skill (seriously)</p><p>Just off topic while I’m writing jargon,</p><p>Philosopher’s Wisdoms</p><p>Seneca  on Anger –>  Strategic pessimism (in certain situations) .

Epicurus lived with his friends and they produced their own simple foods and rejected capitalism.  Epicurus was against working under any person, he rejected the boss-employee notion as it cripples self-sufficiency.</p><p>Study techniques for un-diagnosed ADHD, Bi Polar sufferers and Goldfish</p><blockquote><p> Paring pleasant and unpleasant stimulus ,  i.e music and study.

They lost mine in the fucking mail )</p><p>Skills attempted so far</p><p>Piano – I used to just fiddle with the keys until one day I sat down and watched a tutorial on the chords, I memorized the chords and after a few days of practice I can now pretty much completely improvise songs.  I guess a little understanding goes a long way.</p><p>Golf  &#8211; I’ve been to the driving range a lot and I notice that everyone hits the same shot over and over and none of them seemed that great, so I’m doing it differently.  I’ve been practicing a reversed grip shot, a standalone left hand shot, a standalone right hand and then the generic shot, occasionally lining up balls so I have to think fast to adjust my shot and grip.</p><p>Rational – Of course this looks kind of weird to everyone else, but I seem to be improving quickly. I figure if I improve overall hand-eye co-ordination I will improve at all sports and have a more controlled shot.</p><p>I’ve also practiced sledge-hammer swinging ,  I’m at the point where I can swing a 15kg sledgehammer with either hand completely controlled with varying angles and force.   This had definitely added a ridiculous amount of strength to my shot.  Of course, you are taking it from me. 😉</p><p>Sketching- I’ve been specifically practicing landscapes.  Learning the fundamentals; mountains, rocks, rivers and what-have-you.  I have moved on to  drawing free hand rather than copying so it seems to be going ‘okay’ there’s room for improvement, I draw like a schizophrenic.</p><p>Coding-  I’ve narrowed this down to following along with video tutorials on HTML and CSS.  I’ve since moved on to PHP and am learning the fundamentals.  I intend to move on to C++ from there.</p><p>Front Flip &#8211;  I have wanted to do this for a long time, I tried to watch heaps of videos on the technique and I can do it on trampolines, but outside in the backyard, holy shit I froze.

Like my Soul</p><p>Oh such a grand day when you look forward to nothing but an unnaturally early start to the day just to be a mandatory guinea-pig-bitch for some ungrateful self-important Masters student studying reaction times. I arrogantly believe I could design better and more innovative and entertaining experiments than the ones assigned to us. Most experiments involve clicking a single button whenever something appears on the screen. During verbal fluency experiments, the experimenter just stares at you in this judgemental, analytical way. The way my piece of shit GP looked at me when I went to his office with swollen tonsils and a cold and he said it was hay-fever , sending me away to suffer with a sore throat and blocked nose feeling like a guilty hypochondriac. Anyway, I messed up this experiment one morning. I got there late went to the wrong room etc. I then sent an apologetic email and got this cold one sentence saying that it,</p><p>‘Wasn’t an excuse’ and ‘I don’t know how you could get confused with that?’</p><p>“That’s right,” I replied, “It wasn’t an excuse, rather an apology. Best of luck finding further more spatially aware guineapigs. With love, James.</p><p>Frankly, I’m at the point where I see most people as ‘having done a course,’ rather than ‘professionals.’ The term itself suggests that they have plateaued at some optimal level, like there is no more room for growth.  Isn’t that just like saying ‘Taxi drivers are the best drivers,’ in other words that years driving means better driving. Heck, I’m on my Red P plates so I’m fresh out of the mill. I had a-lot of lessons, hundreds of dollars’ worth.  Not gloating (why would anyone gloat about that?) I’m just establishing that isn’t an ‘everyone is an idiot on the road except for me’ thing… Who am I kidding, of course it is! Driving almost every day now, I’ve noticed that 90% of drivers break some law and yes, I’m pulling stats out of my ass here.  Either they don’t indicate properly, drive one handed like a fucking cowboy with an arm and cig out the window, (Not against the law but still aggravating. The cigarette makes it worse) cross unbroken lines or invent their own speed limits! Fourty in the ‘sixty zone’ seventy in the ‘school zone’ etc. I couldn’t count on both hands the amount of times I’ve had some middle-aged expressionless dark-glasses wearing driver tailgate me hard in a fifty zone. (I like to call this un-consensual harassment of the rear) What gets to me the most is that probably assume by default that they are safer drivers. Gee, that’s what Australian stats say and we all know how accurate stereotypes and generalisations are!</p><p>On a side note I’m paying a lot of money (well, future me) for what seems to be limited education. I think on average I have four-five hours in lectures and tutes in the usual week.  Other time is consumed by travel, sleeping due to early start times and at the Tavern. I asked a tutor why we had such irrelevant boring texts to read for our Comm course. She replied;</p><p>“Because you should be spending one-hour out of class for every hour in!” I then said,</p><p>“Well isn’t that just quantity over quality?”</p><p>She simply shook her head and said “no.”</p><p>Good to see I’m finally, getting some answers around here right? In any case, I have faith that one day I’ll get to the bottom of ‘the system’ and ‘the real world’ or whatever other miserable and pathetic word you use to vaguely describe some way of living that you were born into.</p><p>Expanding more on this, why is time always is managed in blocks? Why can’t we just have tasks or objectives? You know, things to do rather than blocks of time, as makes logical sense.  A sprinter doesn’t plan to be spending one hour sprinting, he/she has planned sets of distances etc. The goal is to complete the task (the sprints) as quickly and effectively as possible and I feel this should be the goal of work.  This bullshit 10 hour study week doesn’t help anyone, it’s just like working out 10 hours every day and expecting to bulk hard like Kim-John-Uhng. (Doesn’t deserve his name spelt correctly) Fuck it, just make everything a game.  Give me a google-glass with achievements, waypoints and with inconspicuous access to porn and I’ll stop complaining.</p><p>If it wasn’t obvious enough from the title, I feel like I’m becoming part of the wall.  Or at least, it’s equivalent. My position as ‘student’ is to sit and listen.  A routine all too familiar from school days.  It takes just about every ounce of strength to break free from that harsh primary school conditioning taught by baby-boomers.  Discipline, hand-raising and being silent unless spoken to. The complete guide on being a pussy who achieves nothing in life.  Well I guess we need to cut them some slack, there were after all taught with capital punishment and whipping, more than a decade and I half later I’m still getting over the ‘Hitler-youth’ regime and that authority figure anxiety.  I’m honestly questioning why I’m not an arsonist.</p><p>With love,</p><p>Teen angst incarnate</p><p>boredomexperiencehomogeneitylifepurposelessrantuni<br /> inspitation, Uncategorized<br /> Intolerance, Agression and Facebook Totalitarianism<br /> November 7, 2013 mcpherson Leave a comment<br /> I recently got into a facebook brawl, one of many.</p><p>NATO-Preparing-For-World-War-3-1<br /> Ladies and Gentlemen, this is WWIII.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking, yeah it was really silly of me.  I slipped, I forgot that trying to discuss topics on social mediums is like trying to convince angry conservative cows that they have three stomachs.  Frankly, It’s made me feel ashamed to be in this country.  To any readers, remember this is Australia, we support the poor/disabled/low-income people we have ‘Obama-Care.’  What a stupid intolerant name for something you should have anyway but I’ll leave that alone for now.</p><p>In passing I commented on this status, almost without a second thought. It was with regards to giving homeless people on the street money.  I’m sure that some people are already flaming, thinking they know my point-of-view here, as did everyone on facebook.  Hear me out.</p><p>abuse</p><p>While my opinion seems republican, once we get to dissecting it (in response to a personal attack) I explain how it’s actually the more liberal-democratic view helping a much greater number.  More bang for the same buck.</p><p>Raising this point I was met with perhaps one legitimate response directed at my ignorance (which I don’t deny) that homeless people cannot get bank accounts apparently, I took that.  All other comments however were directed entirely at me, so many ad hominem (argument against the man) fallicies instead of critical reasoning against the argument.  Everyone is terrified of leaving the comfort of their own minds and the lash out and defend it with everything they have.  It’s exhausting.</p><p>Capture2</p><p>I admit this guy called me out on this one, put like that I sound like an ass, so I clarified what I had mean’t to say being a tad cheeky with the vocab. It’s frustrating trying to reason with the unreasonable.</p><p>Captur3e</p><p>Just abuse! Yay! Young people these days are so promising aren’t they?</p><p>Oh shit, we even got some Gen X ladies in here! At this point my heart was racing, how can people be so enraged by the comment of some random guy?  Then get even more aggravated when you explain what they questioned!</p><p>Captu6re</p><p>I’m not even going to get into the fact of how not being ‘university educated’ has anything to do with not being able to differentiate ‘judgement’ from ‘opinion’ or as an excuse for an inability to Google.  It almost sounds like a bitter jealousy and it’s full of stereotypes and assumptions.  Both of which are horrible parasites of the mind.</p><p>Let’s throw some ageism in the mix!  I’m not experienced enough…. What for?  An opinion? I guess once I pass the 30 mark everything I say will suddenly have more merit.  Let’s be honest  lady, you don’t seem very experienced in English or emotional intelligence (I’m not saying that I have any) but because you served soup to homeless people you are the infallible Pope and I’m the villain, yes, that’s it, I’m the Jew, I’m the reason you have bad finances!</p><p>Someone correct me if I’m wrong (which I’m not) but $50.00 AUD goes a lot further if you send it through a charity that helps build communities or services.  When people see homeless people they feel bad, obviously, but somehow when things are ‘out of sight, out of mind’ it doesn’t matter, all that matters is the intention.  Let’s build a world on good intentions and call it fucking Narnia!  A place where Morgan freeman is God and Michael Jackson is sings Thriller in the town square for eternity!  Well shit, Hitler probably had good intentions.</p><p>In the end she brings up that she participated in one of the services (which is what I initially referred to in saying that they don’t need our street change) in my first comment, but I let it go, it wasn’t worth any more energy.</p><p>materuial</p><p>The comparison between myself and her nephew (the one who posted the status) is kind of ironic, the poster of the status is a very nice chap but has a strong persisting reputation for lying in status’ and I know for a fact that he generates followers on his facebook to look more popular.  There you have it.  Every vocal person on this social media medium seems intolerant and self-righteous.  At times like these I think we should employ Country wide Pluralism, (Group of elites run the country without citizen consent) But I hope it’s not that bad in reality.</p><p>Oh yeah and straight after I took those screenshots, the abusive guy deleted his comments so it looked like I was swearing at the Gen X woman/mother!  That wouldn’t have gone down well at all.  Is there any integrity or reason anymore?

It’s great, she’s enjoying it, it’s easier on the family and everyone is happy, the world is good right?  Well that is questionable.  Being a long time church-goer and friend of the priest she was able to pull some strings…  By that I mean her Parish Priest had a word with the authority figures of the aged care home and got her from fifth-on-the-list to straight into the home!  It didn’t end there, another elderly relative had the same special treatment from the same priest.</p><p>I asked my Grandma about the issue.  “Gran, what do you think about Aunty Jean and Aunty Josie jumping the queue?  (Trying to propose the question as neutrally as possible) What about everyone else? ” She replied with,</p><p>“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”</p><p>A phrase that seems to be irritatingly common with that generation.</p><p>Hold up, is that a justification?  (Of course I didn’t quiz her on this).  Life-long parishioners and the Parish Priest of a Catholic Church are okay with this behaviour?  Do they not worship Jesus?  The man who ate with sinners, gave away all his possessions, put himself last and died for humanity?</p><p>I don’t know about you, but to me this is ridiculously paradoxical.</p><p>If the religious and faithful prove to be just as selfish as the rest of us, surely the only reason they ‘follow’ it is tradition, community or fear of death.</p><p>But hey, I guess I wouldn’t be in the first world if my ancestors weren’t psychopathic selfish pricks.</p><p>I can only hope that by the end of my life I will have reached a higher level of understanding and wisdom…  Or maybe it’s best not to, I’ll likely get crucified or shot.</p><p>Until next time!</p><p>Catholic ChurchCatholicismChristianityDenominationsParishParish PriestPriestReligion and Spirituality<br /> Uncategorized<br /> My Outsourcing Experiences<br /> November 6, 2013 mcpherson 1 Comment<br /> This was Originally Posted on July 28, 2013 to a second blog of mine.

Also, I’m coming back as a cow. PREPARE TO WORSHIP ME, thanks.</p><p>—————————————————————————————————————</p><p>Through my dealings online this mid-year break, I think I have learned a thing or two about outsourcing. That is, sending projects or work to third world countries to be completed for a low price. As $1(US Dollar) is currently worth $59.08 (Indian Rupee) I can’t see how this doesn’t benefit both parties. Maybe one side more than the other.</p><p>The majority of overseas ‘workers’ I have been in contact with are absolutely horrible awful and at a primary school level of English competency. They are all out to make a quick dollar. They don’t care too much about the job and will lie, deceit and do whatever it takes to get the better end of the deal. They will present this completely falsified portrait of themselves as some amazingly successful businessman who has been doing (insert job here) for 8 years etc. You will later find out that you have a team of 13 year old working for you out of a basement. If I didn’t already make this astronomically clear, quality is shithouse. This kind of manipulation and fraud by ‘poor helpless third-worlders’ is making me xenophobic and I’m a tolerant man.</p><p>I’m having outsources from china, India and other desolate shitholes send me emails hourly. My main email account is virtually unusable, and has since been abandoned like Chernobyl after nukes hit. “Dear sir, would  u like intarsted be in or offers? <em>lists offers</em>,” I think I’m having heart palpitations, it’s just so frustrating, all of it and I’m filled with rage, murderous rage. This truly is a ‘Nut Grindin’ situation to be in.</p><p>My freelance.com account is filled with all these messages and false bids. For example, I’ll post an advertisement clearly stating the job, and my budget, let’s say ’$10-30’ for a couple articles. I will have an inbox is soulless leeches trying to make me their gold whore or money bunny, what have you. Placing bids of $10 publicly and then private messaging me their $500000 monthly plans and then constantly pestering when I do not reply within an hour. “hello sir?,” “u ther?” “can do job giv details start now.” No you can’t start now, you stupid inarticulate, scammy fucker, you can start with drowning yourself in a pool of my finances, which to me is virtually 50 bucks and some pubic hair, but is to a third-worlder (apparently) a profitable oil-mining location.</p><p>Oh yeah, I also bought another site online, this one looked decent. The man I purchased it from refuses to pay for site transfer (guess where he’s from! 🙂 India, the trust country!), in which he clearly stated he would in the advertisement, thus purchasing the item under complete false pretence, he vanished off the face of the web, at least the site he left is decent. No one ever stops to think about the poor exploited 1stworlder losing both time, money and sanity. Just because their house are made of clay, they feel that they need not be accountable. (Foreign outsourcers; how do you have internet..?)</p><p>I’m just exhausted and flustered, I can imagine why people like the familiarity and reliability of buying things in person or from trusted, renowned organisations. It makes things easier but for a poor student, that just ain’t gonna happen, and I don’t think I could stomach going back to the workforce just yet, after last year (Refer to gap yearblog). I think I can empathise with that thirteen-year-old workforce who work in a basement, get the job done to their best abilities and don’t get any return (sounds familiar). Back at uni tomorrow, it better be worthwhile this time, I need to meet new people… I learnt all my courses in the two weeks leading to exams (essentially) and spent most of the other time at the Tavern with mates. Drunk uni wooo!(undecided whether or not this is sarcasm) I just got locked out of wordpress for entering the wrong password too many times and my phone ran out of battery so I cannot respond to the password retrieve code… Good game life.</p><p>brazildrunkEmploymentexperiencefunhumourindiaoutsourcingoverseasregretuni<br /> philosophy, humour &amp; some guy bitching about his life.<br />
