                        <h2>Multi Column</h2>ARForms provides excellent functionality to arrange field in multiple columns. You have options to select a number of columns you want in a row.You can arrange fields upto six column.By default field is arranged in one column, you have to arrange it into a required column.

                        <br>
                        <br><strong>2.Two Column:</strong> while clicking on two column icon, as shown below the row will divide into two equal columns.

                        <h2>Resizable Column</h2>Apart from multi-column, ARForms also provides resizing of each column with appealing to the sense UI, here you must aware that resizing of each column can be limit to some maximum and minimum limit upto which any field can be minimized to 15% of its column.
